So, here's my vision. I'd like to work on open source software.
And I'd like to work in mob programming format.
More particularly, I'd like to do Rust and I like the Nix ecosystem.

Here's an idea: a mob that works on various open source projects live stream, publicly.
It provides value to viewers:
get to learn from real, world-class software development.
Five experienced software developers of diverse backgrounds working together and skill sharing between them.
I expect this to provide great value to viewers who wanna learn how to actually do software.

There are solo developers out there doing interesting work.
This mob, however, will use and demonstrate a much greater skill set
and therefore knowledge transfer to the audience in total.
And that includes the mob programming format itself, which is of great value in and of itself.

Revenue sources:

- views
- sponsorships
- donations
- open source contract work

This show will be the de-facto example of how to develop software as a team.
Wor1ldwide, individuals will watch and recommend watching this show.
Similar shows will follow.

I have the time, the skill to facilitate the mob format and I have involvement in open source.

I need an investor to enable a trial period, in which 4 developers will be contracted.
We will work in mob programming format on some open source projects.

I expect the greatest success among the North American audience, but I suppose the trial can occur outside of their hours, as well.

The mob's schedule will be six hours per day.
