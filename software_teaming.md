Allow me to suggest that doing software solo always has been an anti-pattern.
Pioneers such as [Zuil](https://woodyzuill.com/) find software teaming to result in greater safety, sustainability and productivity.
The percieving of software engineers as production floor laborers has been covering over what the software industry can be.

I think most of us don't really want to work solo. We've gotten used to it.
Given the opportunity to experience well-facilitated software teaming,
I think most of us would prefer to collaborate in this manner over working solo (most of the time).
And given confidence to choose how to collaborate, I predict that most of us would.
And seeing the production results of this loosely defined format of collaboration,
I think most of us would consider modifying software solo a generally undesirable practice.

I enjoy showing teams how to collaborate in mob programming format.
And while I'm at it, I am thrilled to practice knowledge sharing.
