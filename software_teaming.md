It's time to actually work together.
Most engineers would rather not work solo.
Yet many have accepted solo work and adapted to it to some extent.

Allow me to suggest that doing software solo always has been an anti-pattern.
Pioneers such as [Zuil](https://woodyzuill.com/) find software teaming to result in greater safety, sustainability and productivity.
Perceiving of software engineers as production laborers has been covering over what the software industry can be.

Given the opportunity to experience well-facilitated software teaming,
I think most of us would prefer to collaborate in this manner over working solo (most of the time).
And given confidence to choose how to collaborate, I predict that most of us would.
And seeing the production results of this loosely defined format of collaboration,
I think most of us would consider modifying software solo a generally undesirable practice.

I am thrilled to accompany teams on their journey into synchonous collaboration.
