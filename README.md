# Mob Programming Facilitation Service

By Shahar "Dawn" Or (mightyiam)

It is becoming increasingly apparent that an alternative to the lonely and arduous path of solo programming exists.
The path has been laid before us by pioneers such as [Zuil](https://woodyzuill.com/).
The stigma — and the reality — of the "lone wolf" heroic solo-developer (or a team of them) has been a shadow covering over what the software industry can be;
a paradise of collaboration.
How did we get here? What went wrong? I'm not sure.
But I am certain we're on to something with mob programming.

See, when I mob (verb) I feel more motivated.
And that should be a great enough benefit to compel further investigation into this activity.
But the benefits don't end with motivation.
This is an activity of which the benefits range as wide and go as deep as to redraw the mental images we hold for the software development activity.

I, Shahar "Dawn" Or, a mob programmer, software developer, open source enthusiast and a few other things,
am offering my service as mob programming facilitator.
I will help your team pick up the mob programming format,
collaborate more closely than they ever did and maximize knowledge and skill sharing among them.
If you wish to invest profoundly in your software development team, encourage them to mob program.
If you'd like to guarantee their success — contract me now.
